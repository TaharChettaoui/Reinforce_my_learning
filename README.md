## Problem: Capsulorhexis
Capsulorhexis or capsulorrhexis, also known as continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), is a technique used to remove the capsule of the lens from the eye during cataract surgery by shear and stretch forces.

Cataract surgery (also called lens replacement surgery) is the removal of the natural lens of the eye (also called "crystalline lens") that has developed an opacification, which is referred to as a cataract, and its replacement with an intraocular lens. Metabolic changes of the crystalline lens fibers over time lead to the development of the cataract, causing impairment or loss of vision. Cataract surgery is a straightforward procedure that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes. It's often carried out as day surgery under local anaesthetic and you should be able to go home on the same day.

In 2022 approximately five million cataract procedures will be performed in the U.S.A. and about 30 million worldwide. 2022 is poised to be a busy year for ophthalmologists. The number of cataract cases in the U.S. sees a compound annual growth rate of roughly 3% to 4% due to the aging of our population and increased life expectancy. In addition to these normal trends, there is still a sizable number of cases that are caught in the backlog from the 2020-2021 pandemic.

### Goals (The main focus is RL)
- Find suiting RL algorithm
- Connect SOFA and RL
- Connect tearing plugin from ludwig (priority) or adapt it if needed
- Focus on examples related to our examples or close 
- New student dont wait for his work but try to benefit from the work, 
- Test on pig eyes (best case)

### ToDo
- Python + SOFA
- RL
- Sim-to-Real RL: researsch on the different methods 
- SOFA Tearing plugins
  - https://github.com/alireza-montazeri/SofaTearing 
  - https://github.com/InfinyTech3D/Tearing
  - https://gitlab.com/polyakovkrylo/sofacutting/-/tree/dev
- FEM models 
- Mass spring networks
